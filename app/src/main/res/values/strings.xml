        "First Inhabitants\n\n"

        "For thousands of years, native peoples traversed land that would become Frederick County. "
        "Historic-era tribes, such as the Susquehannock, Piscataway, and Tuscarora, used the Upper "
        "Potomac and Monocacy River, with surrounding valleys, to hunt wild game and establish small "
        "encampments and villages.\n\n"

        "A watercolor by English artist John White shows a fortified village. The houses are covered "
        "\"some wth matts, and some wth barcks of trees,\" according to White's inscription at the bottom "
        "of the drawing. Residents gather around the fire at the center of the town. A few people can be "
        "seen carrying a bow, another an axe; a dog is seen in the upper left.\n\n"

        "Colonial Life\n\n"

        "In the New World, faith and frugality were guiding principles. Several churches were established "
        "in early Fredericktowne. These served for religious purposes and as centers for education and "
        "social life. The distinct cultures of these early settlers were illustrated by the diverse "
        "architectural designs, styles of dress, cooking traditions and festivities.\n\n"

        "John Thomas Schley (1712-1790) emigrated from Moerzheim, Germany around 1745, and built the "
        "first house in Frederick. He became a naturalized citizen in 1760. Schley was a schoolmaster, "
        "tavern owner, organist, and composer. He was very active in the Reformed Church and was a founding "
        "member of the first fire company in Frederick.\n\n"

        "Establishment of Frederick County\n\n"

        "Europeans established the provincial colony of Maryland in 1634, consisting of settlements "
        "along the Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River in southern Maryland. Slowly, the English colonists "
        "would move toward the interior of the colony, establishing villages along major waterways connecting "
        "to the Potomac and the Bay. The area here was seen by English settlers as untamed, wild and dangerous. "
        "Land speculators and colonial officials wanted to take control of the interior, making these areas "
        "profitable for themselves and the English throne. One such, was Daniel Dulany, an Irish lawyer and "
        "entrepreneur who had possession of a land patent of 7,000 acres adjacent the Monocacy River by the "
        "name of \"Tasker's Chance.\"\n\n"

        "Daniel Dulany knew he could not successfully settle his new community on Maryland's western frontier "
        "with typical English immigrants. He knew Pennsylvania had success in developing its interior thanks to "
        "immigrants from Germany. These people were hard-working, brave and industrious. Over several years, Dulany "
        "sent inducements to German and Swiss peoples in Pennsylvania and Europe to settle on his Tasker's Chance "
        "parcel. Meanwhile, English and Scots-Irish began migrating to Frederick-Town, coming from established towns "
        "and counties of the colony. Frederick-Town would become the county seat.\n\n"

        "Craftspeople\n\n"

        "Fredericktowne became a thriving community, attracting many tradespeople, such as weavers, tailors, "
        "silversmiths, shoemakers, tanners, blacksmiths, potters, and wheelwrights. About seven out of eight citizens "
        "were farmers, and other professionals ranged from newspaper publishers to innkeepers. As the town grew, "
        "talented craftspeople helped establish Fredericktowne as a notable crossroads where makers of glass, furniture, "
        "clocks, jewelry, and hats could be found. These locally made items contributed to the resident's quality of life.\n\n "

        "E. Frederick Klein was born in Wurtemberg, Germany. In 1790, After serving as a baker in the army in Switzerland, "
        "he sailed to America and, for two years, worked as a baker in Pennsylvania. For 19 years, he ran a bakery in Baltimore. "
        "Due to ill health, he moved to Frederick County in 1840.\n\n"

        "Revolutionary War\n\n"

        "Residents of varying cultures banded together in the 1770s in their fight for independence. The American Revolution "
        "attracted a new wave of Europeans to settle in Fredericktowne in a most unorthodox manner. These were the Hessians, "
        "German mercenary soldiers hired by the British to fight in the American Revolutionary War. Some were captured at the "
        "battles of Saratoga, New York, and Yorktown, Virginia, and were imprisoned in the Frederick Barracks in the south area "
        "of town. Finding friendly residents who shared their native tongue, many Hessian soldiers made Frederick their home at "
        "war's end, rather than return to Europe.\n\n"

        "Conrad Engelbrecht (1758-1819), a tailor from Eichig, near present-day Bayreuth, Germany. He was a Hessian soldier "
        "hired by the British to suppress the Revolutionary War. He was the father of Jacob Engelbrecht and is buried across "
        "the street from this museum in the Evangelical Lutheran Church graveyard. Jacob Engelbrecht (1797-1882), served Frederick "
        "as a tailor, musician and major. He was also a diarist, whose observations are valuable today for its many perspectives.\n\n"
